### Super Space Arcade
A voxel based space shooter made with [Unity3D](http://www.unity3d.com).
The models are made with [Qubicle](http://minddesk.com/) and some post-processing with TheFoundry's [Modo](http://www.thefoundry.co.uk).

### Setting up the project
You'll need to have some 3rd party packages from the Unity Assets Store for this project to compile cleanely:
 - [Path-O-Logical PoolManager](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/1010)
 - [Stompy Robots SRDebugger](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/27688)
 - [Dadako's Pixel Art Fonts](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/42363)
 
If you don't own some of these it might be possible, especially for e.g. the SRDebugger, to disable them and build the game without it. Other packages like the PoolManager are essential.

When I started the project I didn't think about releasing it so openly, so that's the reason why there are som many 3rd party packages involved. I do think you might be able to take away something from e.g. the procedural linear track generator and the models.
