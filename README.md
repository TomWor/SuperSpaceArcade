### Super Space Arcade
A voxel based space shooter made with [Unity3D](http://www.unity3d.com).
The models are made with [Qubicle](http://minddesk.com/) and some post-processing with TheFoundry's [Modo](http://www.thefoundry.co.uk) and [Blender](http://www.blender3d.org).

### Setting up the project
You'll need to have some 3rd party packages from the Unity Assets Store for this project to compile cleanly:

 - [Path-O-Logical PoolManager](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/1010)
 - [Master Audio: AAA Sound](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/5607)

These might be omitted but require disabling or replacing them

 - [Stompy Robots SRDebugger](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/27688)
 - [Dadako's Pixel Art Fonts](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/42363)

Also used in the creation of this game, but not necessary

 - [Shader Forge](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/14147)
 - [ProCore ProGrids 2](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/4466)

When I started the project I didn't think about releasing it so openly, so that's the reason why there are some 3rd party packages involved. I do think you might still be able to take away something from e.g. the procedural linear track generator and the models without buying those packages. If building fails or you have any questions, please file an issue or mail me.
